Why does Pulp Smash exist? What are its goals, and what does it *not* do?

Why Pulp Smash?
---------------

Pulp Smash exists to make testing Pulp easy.

Scope and Limitations
---------------------

Portability
~~~~~~~~~~~

Pulp Smash should be usable in any environment that supports:

* one of the Python versions listed in ``.travis.yml``,
* the dependencies listed in ``setup.py``,
* a \*nix-like shell,
* the `XDG Base Directory Specification`_,
* and `OpenSSH`_ or a compatible clone.

In addition, we recommend that `GNU Make`_ or a compatible clone be available.

This level of portability [1]_ allows Pulp Smash to be accessible [2]_.

Provisioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pulp Smash is not concerned with provisioning systems. Users must bring their
own systems.

Destructiveness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Pulp Smash is highly destructive!* You should not use Pulp Smash for testing if
you care about the state of the target system. Pulp Smash will do the following
to a system under test, and possibly more:

* It will drop databases.
* It will forcefully delete files from the filesystem.
* It will stop and start system services.

Pulp Smash treats the system(s) under test as cattle, not pets. [3]_

Contributing
------------

Contributions are encouraged. The easiest way to contribute is to submit a pull
request on GitHub, but patches are welcome no matter how they arrive.

Making Changes

 * Create a branch from where you want to base your work. Pulp Smash uses a
   single master branch model.
 * Assure that you are using the most updated master branch to create your branch.
 * Making commits of logical units.
 * Run ``make all`` and fix programming style errors.
 * Make sure your commmit messages are according to `code standards`_

Learning Pulp Smash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not sure where to start? Consider reading an existing test module, creating a
development environment, and tackling an open issue.

The :doc:`/introductory-module` is a great candidate for study.

:doc:`/installation` provides a recipe for creating a virtualenv-based
development environment. To verify the sanity of your development environment,
``cd`` into the Pulp Smash source code directory and execute ``make all``.

The `Pulp Smash issues`_ list includes test cases that should be automated and
added to the test suite.

Code Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please adhere to the following guidelines:

* Pull requests must pass the `Travis CI`_ continuous integration tests. These
  tests are automatically run whenever a pull request is submitted. If you want
  to locally verify your changes before submitting a pull request, execute
  ``make all``.
* Test failures must not be introduced. Consider running all new and modified
  tests and copy-pasting the output from the test run as a comment in the GitHub
  pull request. The simplest way to run the test suite is with ``python3 -m
  unittest pulp_smash.tests``. See the unittest `Command-Line Interface`_ and
  ``python3 -m pulp_smash`` for more information.
* Each commit in a pull request must be atomic and address a single issue. Try
  asking yourself: "can I revert this commit?" Knowing how to `rewrite history`_
  may help. In addition, please take the time to write a `good
  <http://stopwritingramblingcommitmessages.com/>`_ `commit
  <https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message>`_
  `message <http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`_. While not *strictly*
  necessary, consider: commits are (nearly) immutable, and getting commit
  messages right makes for a more pleasant review process, better release notes,
  and easier use of tools like ``git log``, ``git blame`` or ``git bisect``.
* The pull request must not raise any other outstanding concerns. For example,
  do not author a commit that adds a 10MB binary blob without exceedingly good
  reason. As another example, do not add a test that makes dozens of concurrent
  requests to a public service such as docker hub.

These next guidelines **are not** mandatory, but will match the formatting adopted
in the existing code base.

* Docstrings should not end with a blank line.
* Lines should be hard wrapped at 79 characters.
* Comments should typically be preceded by a blank line.

Review Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two main areas to be reviewed: code standards and the logic that this
new piece of code is introducing.

Pulp Smash team is relying on automation tools to verify the code standards,
and constantly looking for ways to increase this automation. Thus allowing the
reviewer to focus in the logic itself.

Changes that meet the `code standards`_ will be reviewed by a Pulp Smash
developer and are likely to be merged.

Though commits are accepted as-is, they are frequently accompanied by a
follow-up commit in which the reviewer makes a variety of changes, ranging from
simple typo corrections and formatting adjustments to whole-sale restructuring
of tests. This can take quite a bit of effort and time. If you'd like to make
the review process faster and have more assurance your changes are being
accepted with little to no modifications, take the time to really make your
changes shine: ensure your code is DRY, matches existing formatting conventions,
is organized into easy-to-read blocks, has isolated unit test assertions, and so
on.

Labels
~~~~~~

Issues are categorized with `labels`_. Pull requests are categorized with
GitHub's `pull request reviews`_ feature.

The specific meaning of (issue) labels is as follows.

Issue Type: Bug
    This label denotes an issue that describes a specific counter-productive
    behaviour. For example, an issue entitled "test X contains an incorrect
    assertion" is a great candidate for this label.

Issue Type: Discussion
    This label denotes an issue that broadly discusses some topic. Feature
    requests should be given this label. If a discussion results in a specific
    and concrete plan of action, a new issue should be opened, where that issue
    outlines a specific solution and has a label of "Issue Type: Plan".

Issue Type: Plan
    This label denotes an issue that outlines a specific, concrete
    plan of action for improving Pulp Smash. This may include plans for new
    utilities or refactors of existing tests or other tools. Open-ended
    discussions (including feature requests) should go into issues labeled
    "Issue Type:Discussion."

Issue Type: Test Case
    This label indicates that an issue is asking for a test case to be
    automated. (Issues with this label are a special type of plan.)

Pulp Version: 3
    This label serves to differentiate issues, that otherwise should belong
    to one of the above issue types, as being related to creation of automated
    tests or utilities for for Pulp 3. This label is meant to aid
    pulp-smash developers in filtering issues by major version, as Pulp 3
    introduces many breaking changes.

.. [1] Portable software cannot make assumptions about its environment. It
    cannot reference ``/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt``  or call ``yum``.
    Instead, it must use standardized mechanisms for interacting with its
    environment. This separation of concerns should lead to an application with
    fewer responsibilities. Fewer responsibilities means fewer bugs and more
    focused developers.
.. [2] An inaccessible project is a dead project. Labeling a project "open
    source" and licensing it under a suitable terms does not change that fact.
    People have better things to do than bang their head against a wall.
.. [3] The "pets vs cattle" analogy is widely attributed to Bill Baker of
    Microsoft.
